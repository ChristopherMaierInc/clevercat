## 1. Summary

This app was designed as part of the CoderAcademy assignment to build a two-sided marketplace.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
It is difficult to find a tutor cheaply and quickly. Presently you have to sign up through an agency and tutors can be expensive and slow to find. I decided on a tutoring app whilst trying to find a piano teacher for my son. It was impossible to find a tutor to meet on my time and schedule. Students need to find a tutor in real time and cheaply.

SOLUTION
With the immense growth and popularity of on-demand services in other major industries, it makes sense that tutoring will follow.
A tutoring app solves a real problem for students of all ages and parents â€” to find an affordable and knowledgeable tutor on-demand.

The design is based on a two sided marketplace whereby tutors can advertise their skills and students can search for tutors based on their skills and locations. The app allows you to seamlessly contact tutors nearby and schedule a session at a fraction of the cost of traditional services

## 2 Installation
Configuration - you will not have an ENV file as this has been ignored through Git. In order to run the App you will need to create a .env file with your own mailgun and stripe API keys.
1. Clone the repo then change into the directory.
2. Run `bundle install` in terminal.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` in terminal.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory, then add your own ENV variables :
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=`
   - `MAILGUN_API_KEY=`
   - `MAILGUN_DOMAIN_KEY=`
